## Version 0.5

### Breaking

- Deprecated `tabulator(keys, vals)` in favor of `tabulator(OrderedDict(zip(keys, vals)))`
- In `togglebuttons(options, value = x)` `x` should now be one of the values of `options`, rather than one index from `1` to `length(options)`, consistently with all other option widgets
- `style` can no longer be passed as a string but should be passed as a dictionary, i.e. `style=Dict("text-align" => "center", "width" => "100px")`
- `class` can no longer be used, instead one should use the DOM property `className`, i.e. `textbox(className="is-danger")`

### Features

- Observables of widgets can be used in conjunction with `observe`, meaning, if `wdg = Observable(dropdown(["a", "b", "c"]))`, then `observe(wdg)` is an observable that holds the selected value of the dropdown. This is useful when creating a widget from some observable using `map`, for example `options = Observable(["a", "b", "c"]); wdg = map(dropdown, options)`
- Option widgets now store their options as observable, it can be accessed with `wdg["options"]` and modified with `wdg["options"][] = ["d", "e", "f"]`


### Bugfixes

- Option widgets now accept `OrderedDict` with strings as keys and any Julia value as values
- For any widget, changing the Julia observable also updates the visual widget (the javascript value), even for cases where the Julia type has no javascript equivalent
